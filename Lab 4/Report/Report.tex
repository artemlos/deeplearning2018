\subsection*{Checking the gradients}
In order to ensure that the analytical gradients are correct, they are compared with the numerical ones using the relative error metric. The result is summarized in Table \ref{RelError} below:
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
		\hline
		Parameter & Relative error \\
		\hline
		b & 1.8659868439e-09 \\
		c & 3.10398373834e-10\\
		U & 3.96329829198e-09\\
		W & 4.68942450973e-02\\
		V & 7.86033249855e-09\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\caption{Relative error of between the numerical and analytical gradients.}
\label{RelError}
\end{figure}
The $W$ has the highest relative error. When compared element by element, both the numerical and analytical one had mostly the same order of magnitude and similar values. Since the error decreased rapidly during training, reaching less then 43, we can be quite sure that the gradients are correct.

\subsection*{Smooth error with 2 epochs}
When training over the entire passage with 2 epochs and $\epsilon=10^{-4}$, the smooth error loss evolved as shown below. The final loss was $42.984$, which is lower than when training with $\epsilon=10^{-1}$ (i.e. $43.153$).

\subsection*{Evoluation of the synthesized text}
When the code was run with $\epsilon=10^{-4}$ for 100k iterations, the  following results were obtained (when 200 characters were sampled):

\subsection*{Best model}
When a passage of 1000 chars was sampled from the best model (i.e. the one with smooth error $42.984$), the following text was obtained:

\begin{spverbatim}

And, just for fun, let's generate one more:
