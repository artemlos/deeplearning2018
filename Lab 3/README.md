# Assignment 3

The working code (assuming the data set is placed in the right folder) is in `Assignment3.py`, `helpers.py`, `analyse_hyperparam.py` and `methods.py`. I have put them all into `allfiles.py`, without considering the namespaces (no problems should exist as far as I can tell though).

## Summary of files
* `methods.py` - contains the code used for training the two-layer network.
* `helpers.py` - methods that help to read the data from the CIFAR-10 dataset.
* `analyse_hyperparam.py` - contains code to analyse and find the best performing hyper-parameters (given files with results).
* `Assignment3.py` - mix of methods that were used during the assignment (for example, to search for hyper parameters, testing gradients, etc).
